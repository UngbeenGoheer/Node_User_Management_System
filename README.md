# User Management System

- Make folders name small letters like controllers, models, routes

- convert DB folder into config folder and file in it will be db.config.js

- Also change file name in other folders like user.controllers.js, user.routes.js, user.model.js

- Change all fields name PascalCase to camelCase in model file and use camelCase for createing file name if file name have more then one words like js file name example will be emailValidator (this is because in javascript the best case is camelCase so that's why)
